## MIT Web.lab

As part of the MIT 6.148 web.lab: Web Programming class, we built a fully end-to-end website from scratch. On the front end, we employed React and JavaScript to design the components. The integration with the server was written in Node.js. Data was stored using MongoDB and mongoose. This website was designed by Aryan Kumar & Roderick Huang from MIT.

## About

We designed a website that used a scheduling algorithm to combine fixed and variable events together. Essentially, a user would work with the website to create an optimized weekly schedule.The website scheduled variable-time activities (like homework), given parameters like
deadlines and existing fixed-time activities (like classes).
